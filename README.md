# Mobile-app
This app is a handy way to access and use the tickets the user bought on the desktop app. 

The app is written in Java and XML, showing the tickets in a simple interface. The app displays all the essential information about each ticket, such as flight number, departure location, arrival location, airline, and departure time. The app also creates a unique barcode for each ticket, which can be scanned at the entrance to the plane. 

The app requires an internet connection to function, and it is compatible only with tickets purchased on our desktop app. The app is secure, reliable, and easy to use.
