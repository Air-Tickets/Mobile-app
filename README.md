# Mobile-app
This app is a handy way to access and use the tickets that the user has bought on the desktop app. 

The app is written in Java and XML, and it shows the tickets in a simple interface. The app displays all the essential information about each ticket, such as the event name, date, time, location, and seat number. The app also creates a unique barcode for each ticket, which can be scanned at the entrance to the plane. 

The app requires an internet connection to function, and it is compatible only with tickets that were purchased on our desktop app. The app is secure, reliable, and easy to use.
